				<p>
					My name is Caleb. I am a Web Developer. In 2022 I decided to flip
					careers paths from video editing to programming after I fell in love
					with the logic of coding. I enrolled in a full stack web development
					program through Butler University which caught me up in the world of
					programming. I'm excited to see where this new world will take me, and
					can wait to keep learning.
